            <h3>WEB Development</h3>
            <p>
              Web development is the process of building websites and web
              applications, involving both frontend and backend development. The
              frontend is the part users see and interact with, built using
              HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend is the hidden part
              that manages the server, database, and application using tools
              like PHP, Python, and Node.js. A Full Stack Developer manages both
              frontend and backend. Web development also includes tools like Git
              for version control and deployment platforms like AWS and Netlify
              for deploying and managing websites.

            <h3>App Development</h3>
            <p>
              App development involves creating mobile applications for
              platforms like Android and iOS, focusing on both user experience
              and functionality. This process includes frontend design for user
              interactions and backend development for managing data and
              functionality. Tools such as Java, Kotlin, and Swift are commonly
              used for native development, while frameworks like Flutter and
              React Native allow for cross-platform applications. App developers
              also prioritize performance, security, and seamless integration
              with device features to create responsive, reliable apps that
              provide meaningful experiences for users.

            <h3>UI UX Designer</h3>
            <p>
              UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) Design are essential
              in creating visually engaging and user-friendly digital products.
              UI design focuses on crafting intuitive and attractive layouts,
              typography, and color schemes that enhance the visual appeal,
              while UX design ensures that the user journey through the app or
              website is smooth and satisfying. Using tools like Adobe XD,
              Figma, and Sketch, designers work to understand user needs,
              wireframe interfaces, and test designs to refine usability,
              ultimately creating a cohesive experience that aligns with both
              user expectations and brand objectives.
